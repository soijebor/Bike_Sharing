### ***Challenge Overview***

  * Display data professionally and accurately.
  * Professionally style a Tableau story.
  * Utilize previously created Tableau worksheets to create a new story.
  * Create a Tableau story based on starting a bike-sharing company in Des Moines.
  
  To craft this narrative for the investors, you'll do the following:

  * Select your questions. 
    * What is the population of Des Moines? 
    * How does its population compare to the population of New York City? 
    * Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?
  * Execute independent research.
  * Craft your Tableau story.

  * Create a written analysis. 

### ***Written Analysis***
My goal is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. So, I formatted the story so it's persuasive! I also included information about both New York City and Des Moinesâ€”after all, for the investors to understand how the Citi Bike data for New York City applies to our proposal.

#### ***Citibike NYC Analysis***
The citibike program in New York City seems to be booming based on a recent analysis of bike sharing data from August 2019. The average trip duration for riders born between 1960 -1980 seems close except for those born in 1969 where we had a spike in trip duration and the trend for riders born after 1980 tends to a slow upward incline. 72.2% of the bike sharing riders were male riders.

#### ***Des Moines Bike Sharing Analysis***
##### ***Questions???***

  * What is the population of Des Moines? 
  Des Moines has an estimated population as of 2018 from the census data of 215,932 which is about 39 times less than that of NYC which has 8,443,713 
  * How does its population compare to the population of New York City? 
    The Population in New York City is 39 times greater than that of Des Moines
  * Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?
  The population doesn't necessarily affect who will us e the bike sharing program as after doing my research and found out that Des Moines has a lot of visitors yearly.
I also looked into some other questions I had in mind like the relationship between both cities by Poverty level, Age and Gender:
  
  * Poverty Level: The poverty level of Des Moines and NYC are similar, we can expect similar ridership ratio.
  
  * Age Group: Our prime riders are with 25-29 years old so as our population rate for both Des Moines and NYC, but there is steady use from 25-68 years old.
  
  * Gender: From my analysis, I can tell that in both NYC and Des Moines there is a higher percentage of female population.
  
  * Competition: we have a competitor... BCycle

  * Tourism: In 2016, Des Moines welcomed about 13.7 million visitors while NYC had about 67 million
